# CRC32
" Whenever you connect two or more computers together with the intent of exchanging information, you assume that the exchange will take place without errors.
But what if some of the data is lost or corrupted in transit?
Communication protocols usually attempt to detect such errors automatically.
To do that they use checksums. " [CRC Series.](https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/how-to/additive-checksums)
